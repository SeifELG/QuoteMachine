Built using React for as one of the freeCodeCamp Front End certification projects.

Currently uses Babel in-browser to compile JSX to JavaScript. This allows for rapid prototyping and iteration, without having to e.g. set up a local development server. For a production app, you would naturally want to deploy a performance optimised production build.
